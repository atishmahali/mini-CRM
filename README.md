# mini-CRM
Mini CRM, built with React, Node.js, and MySQL, lets you create filters, define audiences, and manage customer profiles. Assign filters to customers, include them in audiences, and update lists easily. This enhances customer segmentation and targeted marketing.

Contributor Notes:

I've added a file called bulkMessages.js to enable sending bulk WhatsApp messages to customers. This file integrates with our CRM to allow easy communication with segmented audiences. Please review and test this feature to ensure smooth operation and integration with the rest of the system.
